  "description" : "Manufacturer's Touch gives randomly generated weapons a bit more character by allowing their creator to play a role on the statistics and appearance of the weapon. In addition, this provides an engine to allow mod makers to create their own manufacturers, as well as make use of resources within, such as explosive bullets.\n\n[b]Make sure to check compatibility to make sure this will work with your other mods![/b]\n\n[b][url=http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/manufacturers-touch.4095/]Link to Starbound forums page for more information.[/url][/b]\n\n[h1]Inspiration[/h1]\n\nRandom weapons are far greater than they were when this game first entered early access. But even with their improvements, I still found them lacking. As I continued to play, I paid more attention to weapons, and found that all weapons in a specific category felt the same, with the exception of elements and damage.\n\nAnd through this, I started paying more attention to the names. My grenade launcher was a Shade Co. one, but it didn't have any identifying characteristics that made it Shade Co. It was just a name, and played no part in the weapon itself.\n\nThis contrasts with the Borderlands series, of which the vast majority of their weapons were randomly created, and nearly every weapon has some randomness in its creation. Despite this, it managed to make weapons of the same type feel very different. Each corporation had its own personality, effects, and style. I would prefer some corporations for some weapons, and different corporations for other types.\n\nSo I set to make every manufacturer in Starbound feel unique. Each corporation should have its own style, and make weapons in their own way. When I use a Callox sniper, it shouldn't feel the same as a Gralux one.\n\n[h1]Gritty Details[/h1]\n\nThis mod gives every random ranged weapon a specific manufacturer, and expanded the amount of information displayed on a weapon's tool tip. When that weapon is created, the manufacturer determined the weapon's name, the palettes that the weapon can use, and the elemental effects that weapon can have. In addition, the manufacturer modifies the individual stats of the gun, giving bonuses and trade-offs.\n\n[h1]Manufacturers[/h1]\n\n[b][url=http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/manufacturers-touch.4095/]See Mod Page for full list of manufacturer effects![/url][/b]\n\n[b]Callox:[/b] Higher DPS than other manufacturers, but much lower fire speed. In addition, the high recoil knocks you back as you fire.\n\n[b]Custom:[/b] Used as a catch-all category for weapons that are custom-built or too heavily modified, custom weapons come in all varieties.\n\n[b]Graxus:[/b] Graxus weapons are always explosive, and fire explosive ammunition that damages in an area on impact. Graxus does not make melee weapons.\n\n[b]Manaticon:[/b] Manaticon weapons are always elemental, and have a variety of minor positive effects in exchange for less damage.\n\n[b]Necrolix:[/b] Necrolix weapons have less knockback and fire slightly slower, but every weapon also fires double the amount of projectiles.\n\n[b]Rotik:[/b] Rotik ranged weapons fire faster than any other, but often deal less damage as a result. However, this decrease in damage doesn't matter once they're firing at max speed, easily surpassing most other manufacturers. Their melee weapons have an increased knockback.\n\n[b]Shade Co.:[/b] Shade Co. makes slow weapons very accurate, and makes fast weapons improve their accuracy the longer you fire. As such, their ranged weapons are more accurate, and their melee weapons attack faster.\n\n[b]Teklacki:[/b]Teklacki rarely make ranged weapons, but their melee weapons are exceptional. They deal much more damage than their competitions, and attack much faster, but also do very little knockback against approaching enemies. Teklacki ranged weapons instead fire needle-like projectiles that are affected by gravity.\n\n[b]Xia-Li:[/b] Xia-Li creates elegant weapons that are very energy efficient, but also less damaging. Their ranged weapons tend to shock the user when their energy is drained, but its much more efficient. Their melee weapons recharge your energy faster while you are using them.\n\n[h1]Compatibility[/h1]\nThis mod is incompatible with any mod that does changes the default weapon build scripts, as well as any mod that changes the weapon tooltip UI.\n\nThis collision is most notable in Tripod's mod, Weapon Stats, which will result in weapons not spawning with a manufacturer and cause weird overlapping in the UI. However, this mod has its own unique tooltip, which should help you deal with this penalty.\n\nFor some mods that change the tool tips but don't replace the weapon build scripts, this patch can help. I changes this mod so that it only adds the manufacturer label to tool tips, and leaves everything else alone.\n\nMods that change the default random weapons are most likely compatible, but they might have strange effects if they make certain (although unlikely) changes.\n\nAny mod that adds new weapon abilities for the randomly generated weapons might lead to some issues with Graxus or Custom weapons, as they might not support the Explosive element. These are not game-breaking, and the weapons that spawn will usually be held weird and be unable to shoot.\n\nThis mod is compatible with Frackin' Universe, but doesn't change the majority of its new weapon types. If you are looking for that, check out [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=951889799]Damn Squid People's mod.[/url]\n\n[h1]Bugs[/h1]\n\nAs much as I hope there are no bugs, I am destined to suffer through errors. I have tested this mod, but it hasn't received a full playthrough in-game, only playthrough of the early planets, along with me mass spawning and testing different random weapons.\n\nIf you come across a bug, please let me know what happened. If you find a weapon that won't fire or is held like a club, please report the weapon's type, rarity, and manufacturer, and any errors in your log file.\n\n[h1]Options[/h1]\n\nYou can change certain settings for this mod, or download additional patches if some mods are still incompatible.\n\nIn order to do so, you [url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2Zet_SaNNd1cmxzRUh6X2dFUHc]need to download this[/url] and put the ManufacturersTouchOptions folder (or any of the patch folders) in your Starbound mod directory (the readme explains it better). Then you can edit the values in manufacturerstouch.config using Notepad for your preferences.\n\n[h1]Source[/h1]\n\n[url=https://github.com/ErriTorri/starbound-manufacturers-touch]For those who care, the Github project for this mod is located here[/url]",
